This path looks like its take you too nowhere. I guess all the path we go
doesn't take you to anywhere as well. That's strange....

(Your team are also exhaunting while walking around this woods for a while
Hope the team manage to get them out before things will get worse if there
are planning to stay longer in the woods)

There is no trace of location where are we at right now. I guess we can
just walk back and see what we can find back then we are just going to
trap in here forever.
