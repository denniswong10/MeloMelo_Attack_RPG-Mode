It's been a day since we left the town, sound like a greeny field and bright sunny day 
as we set journey toward a new town. 

Onwards our path will soon be entering the forest where active activities might happen as 
we are not careful. Let's us stay on guard as monster around us can ambush us in our 
middle way of this path out of the forest side.

As dusk approaching, we shall camp around the middle path through the forest where there 
no danger coming in our way.
