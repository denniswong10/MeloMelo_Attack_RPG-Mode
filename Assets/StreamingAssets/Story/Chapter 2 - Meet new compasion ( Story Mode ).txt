As the story continue, we finally reached the guild tower. Finding ourselves a rest spot
for all adventureer seeking out for quest and party member. In the way, there isn't many
who like to join or risk travelling places which are far from danger, which lead people
lost their life and not to be found.

Your journey are more dense than just finding missing people travelling beyond human
continent but what we can see, is not how we find people which had gone missing, therefore
your journey is to explore deep inside what we can see and reach the other side
of the continent. 

You are tasked to register as a party through finding people you want to join this
adventure. Hope you can get them through the guild tower before departing out to the
wild.
